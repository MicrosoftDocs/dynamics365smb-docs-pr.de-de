      - question: |
          Is there an app for my device?
        answer: |
          Probably! Install the <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> app on your mobile device by downloading the app from the Windows Store, App Store, or Google Play.

      - question: |
          Is it the same experience in the apps as in the browser?
        answer: |
          No, not exactly. For example, we show only the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Home<ept id="p1">**</ept> activity group due to the limited screen size on mobile devices. Similarly, the keyboard shortcuts are not available because you mainly use touch rather than a keyboard to navigate on mobile devices.

          The following table describes some of the most common differences and limitations that you might experience when using <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> on mobile devices, compared to the browser.

      - question: |
          Is it the same experience on tablets and phones?
        answer: |
          Almost, but not quite. See the list in the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Is it the same experience in the apps as in the browser?<ept id="p1">](#is-it-the-same-experience-in-the-apps-as-in-the-browser-)</ept> section.  
      - question: |
          Can I connect the app to our on-premises solution?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can! It's a slightly different way to signing in, that's all. For more information, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Use Business Central on-premises?<ept id="p1">](install-mobile-app.md#use-business-central-on-premises)</ept>.  
      - question: |
          Can a guest user use the app to access our Business Central solution?
        answer: |
          No. Guest users are invited users from a different Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant than yours. In this case, the app will authenticate to the guest user's primary Azure AD tenant and try open the Business Central endpoint on that tenant instead of yours.
