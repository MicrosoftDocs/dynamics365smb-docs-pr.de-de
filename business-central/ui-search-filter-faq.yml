    questions:
      - question: |
          Is there a difference between searching and filtering?
        answer: |
          Yes.
          - Search is simple and broad: it matches records that contain the search text across any visible fields on the page, and is case insensitive.
          - Filtering is highly flexible and can be applied to specific fields, including those not visible on the page: it displays records with exact, case-sensitive matches, but can be adjusted with powerful search symbols, tokens, and formulas. For more information on how to use these features, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Sorting, Searching, and Filtering<ept id="p1">](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md)</ept>.
      - question: |
          Exactly which fields are matched when searching?
        answer: |
          <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> applies the search criteria to all fields that are visible on the page. If a field has been hidden, such as by using personalization, search won't consider this field. Search criteria are applied to fields only if their data type matches that of the search criteria. For example, searching for the term <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>today<ept id="p1">*</ept> will search all text and code fields for the literal value "today", and also any date fields where <bpt id="p2">*</bpt>today<ept id="p2">*</ept> is evaluated as an expression for the current date, but won't search in any numeric fields. For more information on filter criteria, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Sorting, Searching, and Filtering<ept id="p1">](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#-filter-criteria-and-operators)</ept>.
      - question: |
          Is there a keyboard experience for search and filter?
        answer: |
          Search and filter have been highly optimized for users who prefer mouse-free interaction to work efficiently with their data. There are a variety of shortcut keys that can be used in sequence to work at high speed. For more information see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Keyboard Shortcuts<ept id="p1">](keyboard-shortcuts.md#KeyboardFilter)</ept>.
      - question: |
          Is the filter pane available on all lists?
        answer: |
          The filter pane is available on pages where the list is the primary content on the page, such as worksheets and list pages, including lists reachable from the navigation bar. The filter pane is not yet available for lists that are displayed as parts, such as FactBoxes or Role Center parts, or for lists that are shown as dialogs, such as in lookups. When a list is embedded on a page, such as sales lines on a sales order, the filter pane is available when focusing on that list using the focus mode button. For more information, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Focusing on Line Items<ept id="p1">](ui-enter-data.md#Focus)</ept>.
      - question: |
          How can I save my filters?
        answer: |
          Your filters and adjustments to predefined filters are remembered throughout the session (while you remain signed in), even if you navigate away from the page. You can permanently save filters as a named view of the list by choosing the <bpt id="p1">![</bpt>Save View<ept id="p1">](media/save_view_icon.png "|::ref1::|")</ept> icon in the filter pane. For more information, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>List Views FAQ<ept id="p1">](ui-views-faq.yml)</ept>. Note that, unlike filters, search text is not remembered when you navigate away from a page and is not saved when you save a view.

          On report request pages, you can also save filters or use predefined filters. For more information, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Use Saved Settings<ept id="p1">](ui-work-report.md#SavedSettings)</ept>.
      - question: |
          Is this the same as Advanced Filters and Limit Totals in Microsoft Dynamics NAV?
        answer: |
          <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> builds upon these popular features and delivers a modern and highly usable experience for finding and analyzing your data. With more keyboard shortcuts and the introduction of search, <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> surpasses the functionality provided in Dynamics NAV.  
      - question: |
          Can I search and filter using the companion apps and add-ins for Microsoft 365?
        answer: |
          On different display targets, such as mobile devices or in Outlook, you can search in lists but can't filter on individual fields in most cases. In the <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> app for Microsoft Teams, both search and filter are available on lists.
      - question: |
          How do I view how my search terms have been applied to fields in the list?
        answer: |
          After entering search terms in the search box, you can view the exact search criteria and which fields they have been applied to by opening the page inspection pane (<bpt id="p1">&lt;kbd&gt;</bpt>Ctrl<ept id="p1">&lt;/kbd&gt;</ept><ph id="ph1">+</ph><bpt id="p2">&lt;kbd&gt;</bpt>Alt<ept id="p2">&lt;/kbd&gt;</ept><ph id="ph2">+</ph><bpt id="p3">&lt;kbd&gt;</bpt>F1<ept id="p3">&lt;/kbd&gt;</ept>) and choosing the <bpt id="p4">**</bpt>Page Filters<ept id="p4">**</ept> tab.
      - question: |
          Can I do anything about the "Searching for rows is taking too long" message?
        answer: |
          There is a time-limit on how a long a search operation can take. First, try changing the search criteria and search again. If you are using <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> on-premises, contact your system administrator, because an administrator can increase the time-limit for searches.

          As an on-premises administrator, you increase the time-limit on searches by changing the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Search Timeout<ept id="p1">**</ept> setting of <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> server. For more information, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Configuring Business Central Server<ept id="p1">](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance?#Database)</ept> in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro Help.
      - question: |
          Will Microsoft extend the filter pane experience?
        answer: |
          At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse community of users and acting upon the top community suggestions. If you are interested in extending the filter pane to more form factors and more types of lists, or have a great idea on how to improve it, add an idea or vote for existing ideas at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas<ept id="p1">](https://aka.ms/businesscentralideas)</ept>.
      - question: |
          How do I change the output of the decimal separator key on my numeric keypad?
        answer: |
          By default, the output character of the decimal separator is determined by the region setting of Business Central, which you set on the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>My Settings<ept id="p1">**</ept> page. You can temporarily switch it to a period (.) by selecting the <bpt id="p1">&lt;kbd&gt;</bpt>Alt<ept id="p1">&lt;/kbd&gt;</ept><ph id="ph1">+</ph><bpt id="p2">&lt;kbd&gt;</bpt>Decimal Separator<ept id="p2">&lt;/kbd&gt;</ept> keys on the keypad. Select <bpt id="p1">&lt;kbd&gt;</bpt>Alt<ept id="p1">&lt;/kbd&gt;</ept><ph id="ph1">+</ph><bpt id="p2">&lt;kbd&gt;</bpt>Decimal Separator<ept id="p2">&lt;/kbd&gt;</ept> again to switch back. For more information, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards<ept id="p1">](ui-enter-data.md#decimal)</ept>.
