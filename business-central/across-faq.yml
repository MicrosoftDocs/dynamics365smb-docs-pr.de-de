      - question: |
          Why can't I find that capability in my Business Central?
        answer: |
          Did you read about a new capability in the release plan or on our blog recently? In that case, your <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> might not have been upgraded to the latest version yet. You can check which version your <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> is based on in the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Help and Support<ept id="p1">](product-help-and-support.md)</ept> page.  

          This applies to <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> online and on-premises.  

          Also, if the capability is published as an extension in AppSource, then there's a delay between the extension being announced and its availability in AppSource. This applies to <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> online only.  
      - question: |
          Are there any differences between an on-premises deployment and Business Central online?
        answer: |
          Yes. <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> is optimized for online deployment, and some capabilities may run on premises only under certain circumstances, while others aren't supported at all. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Features not implemented in on-premises deployments of Dynamics 365 Business Central<ept id="p1">](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/features-not-implemented-on-premises)</ept> (available in English only).
      - question: |
          Can I get training in Business Central?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can! You can find free eLearning content on the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Microsoft training site<ept id="p1">](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs)</ept>. You can also ask your reselling partner for more training. If you don't know who that is, see the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>How do I find a reselling partner?<ept id="p1">](#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner)</ept> section.  

          For more information about training across Dynamics 365 that is provided by Microsoft, see the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Microsoft Dynamics 365 training<ept id="p1">](/dynamics365/get-started/training/index#dynamics-365-customers)</ept> page.  

          More content is provided by the <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> community, such as the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Field Guide<ept id="p1">](https://leanpub.com/dynamics)</ept> that is written by a partner.  
      - question: How do I get technical support for Business Central?
        answer: |
          <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> is sold through partners, and you should contact your reselling partner to get help with technical problems. If your <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> partner then can't resolve the problem, they'll raise a support ticket with Microsoft.  

          Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Help and Support<ept id="p1">](product-help-and-support.md)</ept> and the <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>How do I find a reselling partner?<ept id="p2">](#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner)</ept> section.  
      - question: |
          Where is the save button?
        answer: |
          there's no <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>save<ept id="p1">*</ept> button on pages like in other programs that you might be familiar with. In <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph>, changes that you make to a field are automatically saved as soon as you move to the next field or close the page, as long as there are no errors. When you make changes to a field and move to another field, you'll see the text <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Saving<ept id="p1">**</ept> in the top-right corner of the page. It changes to <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Saved<ept id="p1">**</ept> quickly if no errors occur. If an error occurs, the text will change to <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Not Saved<ept id="p1">**</ept>.  
      - question: |
          Where do I find that line number?
        answer: |
          Documents such as sales order or purchase invoices consist of headers and lines. Each line has a number that <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> uses to identify this particular line. As a result, you might see a warning or an error message that something is wrong in line number 1000, for example. In the default version of <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph>, line numbers are hidden. If you want to see the line numbers, you must personalize the current page and add the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Line No.<ept id="p1">**</ept> field. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Personalize Your Workspace<ept id="p1">](ui-personalization-user.md#to-start-personalizing-a-page-through-the-personalizing-banner)</ept>.  
      - question: |
          Why does Help describe functionality that I can't access?
        answer: |
          If your Experience setting on the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Company Information<ept id="p1">**</ept> page is set to <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Essential<ept id="p2">**</ept>, then UI elements for the Manufacturing and Service Management features aren't visible to you because they require the <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>Premium<ept id="p3">**</ept> experience. A text note is inserted in high-level help topics for these feature areas. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Change Which Features are Displayed<ept id="p1">](ui-experiences.md)</ept>.  
      - question: |
          Why is new information not available in my language?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Learn content about business functionality is published in several languages. The content is authored in English and published to URLs with <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>en-us<ept id="p1">*</ept> as the language code. When new information is published in English, it's then sent off for translation into the supported languages. This means that you'll not be able to read this new content in your own language for up to four weeks.  

          We understand the problems this can cause, and we encourage users to search for what they're looking for in English if they can't find it in their own language.  
      - question: What email address can I use with Business Central online?
        answer: |
          <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> online requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> online doesn't support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.  

          If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you'll get a message indicating to use a work or school email address. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up<ept id="p1">](ui-troubleshoot-self-signup.md)</ept>.  

          If you want to deploy <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> on-premises, then you can use other authentication methods. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Deployment of Dynamics 365 Business Central<ept id="p1">](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/deployment)</ept>.  
      - question: |
          Do I have to buy Microsoft 365?
        answer: |
          No. But if you want to experience <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> as fully integrated with Microsoft 365, you can sign up for a 1-month free trial of Microsoft 365 <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>here<ept id="p1">](https://products.office.com/try)</ept>.  

          If you sign up with a non-Microsoft 365 work account (such as <ph id="ph1">joe@mysolution.com</ph>), and you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, then you can associate your domain (<bpt id="p1">*</bpt>mysolution.com<ept id="p1">*</ept>) with the Microsoft 365 subscription. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>What is a domain?<ept id="p1">](/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/what-is-a-domain?view=o365-worldwide&amp;preserve-view=true)</ept> in the Microsoft 365 content.  

          If you don't have a Microsoft 365 subscription, and you don't want to buy one, then we provision a new Azure Active Directory tenant for you when you sign up so that you have access to the advanced administration tools in the Azure portal.  
      - question: |
          What is the integration with Microsoft 365 about?
        answer: |
          <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> online is fully integrated with Microsoft 365 so that you can navigate freely between Microsoft 365 apps and <ph id="ph2">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> using the app launcher. In <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph>, you can open data in Excel, print reports using Word, and you can work with your <ph id="ph2">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> data in Outlook, for example. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Use <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> as your Business Inbox in Outlook<ept id="p1">](admin-outlook.md)</ept>.  
      - question: |
          Can I extend my 30-day "New Company" trial period?
        answer: |
          Yes. When the expiration date for your trial period is approaching, we'll display a notification to alert you when you sign in. The notification contains a link to the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Extend Trial Period<ept id="p1">**</ept> guide that you can use to extend your trial period. The extra 30 days start the moment you choose <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Extend Trial<ept id="p1">**</ept> in the guide. You can extend the trial period one time yourself. After that, a Microsoft partner can extend it for another 30 days. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Extend Your Trial Version<ept id="p1">](admin-extend-trial.md)</ept>.

          > [!NOTE]
          > It may take up to two business days to complete the trial extension process.

      - question: |
          What are the service level agreements for the cloud?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE [service-terms](includes/service-terms.md)]
      - question: |
          How often does Business Central online get updated?
        answer: |
          <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> online is a service that consists of a Microsoft-maintained platform and business functionality. Many Microsoft partners provide extra business functionality, such as to address specific industry or localization needs. Both business functionality and service components are monitored continuously and updated as appropriate. You can always refer to the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>release plan<ept id="p1">](/dynamics365/release-plans/)</ept> for an overview of new and upcoming functionality. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Service Overview for Business Central Online<ept id="p1">](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/service-overview)</ept> (in English only) and <bpt id="p2">[</bpt>New and Planned<ept id="p2">](product-news.md)</ept>.
      - question: |
          Our administrator has moved me to another plan to give me another role, but I still see the same Home screen in Business Central?
        answer: |
          It's a bit complicated, but it looks like your administrator didn't change your assigned role and assign user groups that match the new license. Essentially, your access to <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> is determined by the type of plan (license) that you have - this sets permissions, your assigned role and your default Home screen. You can change your current role manually in My Settings. But if you're moved to another plan, such as moving you from the Business plan to the Team Members plan, you might see the old Home screen because your permissions weren't changed.  
      - question: |
          Can I cancel my subscription?
        answer: |
          Yes, but depending on how you signed up to <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph>, your data can be deleted or preserved. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Canceling <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph><ept id="p1">](admin-cancel.md)</ept>.  
      - question: |
          Can I use multi-factor authentication?
        answer: |
          Sure. If you do, you might need an app password in order to send email messages. App passwords give an app or a device access to your email account. The steps for getting an app password vary, depending on your email provider. Learn more at the help from your provider. For example, if you're using Outlook, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Multi-factor authentication for Microsoft 365<ept id="p1">](/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365)</ept>.  
      - question: How do I find a reselling partner?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          Is the Windows client supported?
        answer: |
          The first releases of <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph> on premises included an installable client derived from Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Starting with 2019 release wave 2, this legacy component, referred to as "the Windows client", is no longer available for <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]</ph>. Learn more at <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>FAQ About the Windows Client and Business Central<ept id="p1">](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/faq-win-cli)</ept>.
