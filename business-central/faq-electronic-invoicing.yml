title: Electronic Invoicing FAQ
summary: |
  The built-in document exchange service submits electronic invoices to TradeShift, a  service provider that relays electronic invoices to PEPPOL or NemHandel recipients. But the service supports a limited number of versions.   

  This FAQ answers some of the key questions about electronic invoicing.  
sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: What is the problem?
        answer: The built-in support of PEPPOL uses an API provided by TradeShift. But that API does not support newer versions of PEPPOL.
      - question: Which is last version of PEPPOL supported by the TradeShift API?
        answer: The last version of PEPPOL supported by the TradeShift API is <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>PEPPOL BIS 2.1<ept id="p1">**</ept>.
      - question: Which is last version of PEPPOL supported by Business Central?
        answer: 'The last version of PEPPOL supported by the default version of Business Central is <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>PEPPOL BIS 3.0<ept id="p1">**</ept>. We will keep the existing document exchange service based on TradeShift running as long as TradeShift supports the current API. Additionally, we continue to support the currently supported electronic invoicing formats.'
